#+TITLE: Learning cubing heuristics for SAT from DRAT proofs

Steps to reproduce results:

1. Clone repository to ~neurocuber-public~
2. Enter a virtual environment with ~python>=3.6=~. From inside the virtual environment, run ~pip3 install -r requirements.txt~
3. Install the pybind11 wrappers around Z3 by cloning https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 to ~neurocuber-public/z3/z3/~. Adjust ~CMakeLists.txt~ according to your system and install using ~python3 setup.py install~.
4. For data generation, compile the modified version of ~drat-trim~ in ~neurocuber-public/tools/~ by using ~gcc~.
5. Ensure that ~cadical~ is installed (https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical).
6. Adjust global variables in ~config.py~ according to your system.
4. Run ~bash reproduce_results.sh~. This will take several days; parallelize this as required.
